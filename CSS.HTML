    <h1>Wellcome To Phnum Penh!</h1>
    <p>
        A mixture of Asian exotica, the famous Cambodian hospitality awaits visitors to the capital of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
        Situated at the confluence of three great rivers, the ‘four arms’ of the Mekong, Tonle Sap and Bassac, form right in front of the Royal Palace. 
        Phnom Penh is the commercial, political and cultural hub of the Kingdom and is home to over one million of the country’s estimated 11.4 million people.
        It is also the gateway to an exotic land….the world heritage site, the largest religious complex in the world, 
        the temples of Angkor in the west, the beaches of the southern coast and the ethnic minorities of the northeastern provinces.

    <p>   The city offers several cultural and historical attractions including the Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda and the National Museum. 
        There are also a wide variety of services including five star hotels and budget guest houses, fine international dining, sidewalk noodle shops, neighborhood pubs, international discos and more.

        Phnom Penh, like other Asian-city tourist destinations, is in the midst of rapid change. Over the past few years, the number of restaurants and hotels have grown considerably and in the last year there has been a huge increase in the number of visitors. 
        Three overland border crossings have opened since 1998 and now there are daily direct flights from several Asian cities. 
        Even travel within the country is easier with road conditions gradually improving, several airlines flying domestic routes, and regular bus service to major cities like Sihanouk ville and Kampong Cham. 
        Cambodia is becoming easier to visit everyday.
